# 📝 Notes App

A simple fullstack **Notes App** built with **React** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. This project was created for practice and learning, and it's my first fullstack app developed entirely by myself. The backend is deployed on **Render**, and the frontend is hosted on **Vercel**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React
- Material UI (MUI)
- Axios
- Deployed on Vercel

**Backend**
- Spring Boot
- Java 17+
- H2 Database (file-based)
- Docker
- Deployed on Render


> ⚠️ **Note:** The backend is hosted on **Render's free tier**, which may result in:
> - **Cold starts**: The server "sleeps" when inactive, causing the first request to take up to 30 seconds to respond.
> - **Limited resources**: Occasional slow performance or timeouts during high traffic or load.
> - **Intermittent downtime**: The free tier may experience short outages or redeployments without warning.
> -  No login or auth — purely for practice and learning.


**What I Learned**
- React and state management
- Spring Boot API development
- Connecting frontend and backend
- Deploying fullstack apps (Render + Vercel)
- Using Docker and environment variables
